                            Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), also known as narrow AI or weak AI, describes AI tools
                            designed to carry out very specific actions or commands. ANI technologies are built to serve
                            and excel in one cognitive capability, and cannot independently learn skills beyond its
                            design. They often utilize machine learning and neural network algorithms to complete these
                            specified tasks.

                            For instance, natural language processing AI is a type of narrow intelligence because it can
                            recognize and respond to voice commands, but cannot perform other tasks beyond that.

                            Some examples of artificial narrow intelligence include image recognition software,
                            self-driving cars and AI virtual assistants like Siri.

                        Artificial superintelligence (ASI), or super AI, is the stuff of science fiction. It’s theorized
                        that once AI has reached the general intelligence level, it will soon learn at such a fast rate
                        that its knowledge and capabilities will become stronger than that even of humankind.

                        ASI would act as the backbone technology of completely self-aware AI and other individualistic
                        robots. Its concept is also what fuels the popular media trope of “AI takeovers,” as seen in
                        films like Ex Machina or I, Robot. But at this point, it’s all speculation.

                        “Artificial superintelligence will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on
                        earth,” said David Rogenmoser, CEO of AI writing company Jasper. “It will have the intelligence
                        of human beings and will be exceedingly better at everything that we do.”

                        machines, the most fundamental type of AI. Reactive machines are just that — reactionary. They
                        can respond to immediate requests and tasks, but they aren’t capable of storing memory or
                        learning from past experiences.In practice, reactive machines can read and respond to external
                        stimuli in real time. This makes them useful for performing basic autonomous functions, such as
                        filtering spam from your email inbox or recommending movies based on your most recent Netflix
                        searches.

                        Most famously, IBM’s reactive AI machine Deep Blue was able to read real-time cues in order to
                        beat Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a 1997 chess match. But beyond that, reactive
                        AI can’t build upon previous knowledge or perform more complex tasks. In order to apply AI in
                        more advanced scenarios, developments in data storage and memory management needed to occur.

                        next step in AI’s evolution is developing a capacity for storing knowledge. But it would be
                        nearly three decades before that breakthrough was reached, according to Rafael Tena, senior AI
                        researcher at insurance company Acrisure Innovation.“There was a huge amount of progress in the
                        80s,” Tena said. But that eventually slowed. “There were small incremental changes …until deep
                        learning came around.”

                        In 2012, the field of AI made major progress. New innovations from Google and Image Net made it
                        possible for artificial intelligence to store past data and make predictions using it. This type
                        of AI is referred to as limited memory AI, because it can build its own limited knowledge base
                        and use that knowledge to improve over time. Today, the limited memory model represents the
                        majority of AI applications.

                        “Nearly all existing applications that we know of come under this category of AI,” Rogenmoser
                        said. “All present-day AI systems are trained by large volumes of training data that they store
                        in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems.”

                        Limited memory AI can be applied in a broad range of scenarios, from smaller scale applications,
                        such as chatbots, to self-driving cars and other advanced use cases.</h6>

                    </u>
                    <h6 class="card-text">In terms of AI’s progress, limited memory technology is the furthest we’ve
                        come
                        — but it’s not the final destination. Limited memory machines can learn from past experiences
                        and store knowledge, but they can’t pick up on subtle environmental changes, emotional cues or
                        reach the same level of human intelligence.

                        “Current models have a one-way relationship,” Rogenmoser said. “AI [tools] like Alexa and Siri
                        don’t react with any emotional support when you yell at them.”

                        The concept of AI that can perceive and pick up on the emotions of others hasn’t been fully
                        realized yet. This concept is referred to as “theory of mind,” a term borrowed from psychology
                        that describes humans’ ability to read the emotions of others and predict future actions based
                        on that information.Tena provided an example to illustrate how a successful theory of mind
                        application would revolutionize the technology: A self-driving car may perform better than a
                        human driver the majority of the time because it won’t make the same human errors. But if you,
                        as a driver, know that your neighbor’s kid tends to play close to the street after school,
                        you’ll know instinctively to slow down while passing that neighbor’s driveway — something an AI
                        vehicle equipped with basic limited memory wouldn’t be able to do.

                        Theory of mind could bring plenty of positive changes to the tech world, but it also poses its
                        own risks. Since emotional cues are so nuanced, it would take a long time for AI machines to
                        perfect reading them, and could potentially make big errors while in the learning stage. Some
                        people also fear that once technologies are able to respond to emotional signals as well as
                        situational ones, the result could mean automation of some jobs. But no need to worry just yet —
                        Rogenmoser said that this hypothetical future, however, is still very far off.

                        “Right now, this intelligence is science fiction,” he said. “We’re not even close to developing
                        this type of AI, so no one is getting their job stolen by AI.”</h6>

                    </u>
                    <h6 class="card-text">The stage beyond theory of mind, when artificial intelligence develops self
                        awareness, is referred to as the AI point of singularity. It’s thought that once that point is
                        reached, AI machines will be beyond our control, because they’ll not only be able to sense the
                        feelings of others, but will have a sense of self as well.

                        “People both strive to create this type of AI and fear the consequences of its creation,
                        worrying that this type of AI could steal our jobs or take over our world,” Rogenmoser said. “If
                        this type of AI is successfully created, no one knows what the impact will be.”Steps are being
                        taken by researchers and engineers to develop rudimentary versions of self-aware AI. Perhaps one
                        of the most famous of these is Sophia, a robot developed by robotics company Hanson Robotics.

                        While not technically self aware, Sophia’s advanced application of current AI technologies
                        provides a glimpse of AI’s potentially self-aware future. It’s a future of promise as well as
                        danger — and there’s debate about whether it’s ethical to build sentient AI at all. But for now,
                        Rogenmoser said we don’t need to worry about AI conquering the world.

                        “AI is going to become much better at solving real use cases, but I want to express that I don’t
                        think this [means] the end of humans and the end of work,” he said. “We will continue to see AI
                        pop up in useful ways to amplify the great work that people are already doing.”</h6>
